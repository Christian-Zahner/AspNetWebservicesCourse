# Web Services Course FH-Rosenheim

## Hi there

This repository contains source code for the **Web Services with .NET** course. It's used during the presentation so that the students can follow
along more easily.

I try to always deliver up-to-date content during the course. The .NET (Core) World moves fast!

You can find older course material inside the archive folder.

I'm looking forward to show you what .NET and Web Services are capable of.

I can't wait to learn new stuff with you!
